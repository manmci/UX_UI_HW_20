                    <h4 id="overview">Project Overview</h4>
                    <p>iHype is a software toy designed to help people who are introverted decide if they should keep plans with their friends or not. It's a fun way to help users talk through their feelings, without the empty toxic positivity of motivational apps, or feeling like they're burdening their friends.</p>
                    <p>For this project, I worked with two other designers as team lead. My main focus was graphic and UI design and programming. Tools used used in the project were Figma, Miro, Adobe Illustrator, VSCode, and GitHub.  iHype was built during a design sprint lasting 2 1/2 weeks of in-class time, roughly working out to 60 real-world hours.</p>
                    <h4 id="research">User Reasearch</h4>
                    <p>As a team, we interviewed 6 potential users. We wanted to learn about our user's perceptions and experiences of motivational apps, how users self-motivate, and how they define "toxic positivity".</p>
                    <div class="quote-row">
                        <div class="quote">“[Motivational apps] do it in a way that doesn't feel genuine and doesn't really highlight that it's okay to struggle on your way to success.”</div>
                        <div class="quote">“What might turn me away [from motivational apps]? I guess when they are too motivational it can be a little bit weird. Like when they're aggressively positive.”</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Our interviewees considered hollow quotes that did not acknowledge how they were feeling to be insulting rather than motivating. Phrases like "girlboss" "grind" and "hustle" were also pointed out as empty. Respondents wanted their negative emotions to be acknowledged, but also reminded that they are temporary.</p>
                    <p>In our competitor analysis, we found the motivational app market to be predatory. The vast majority of apps had paywalls for the most helpful features, and some even had mandatory free trials that the user had to remember to cancel. One app we reviewed even seemed to exist solely to sell ad space. It was designed like a facebook-style social networking site, but there was very little activity, and there were banner ads at the top and bottom of each page. It felt to us that these developers were preying on people who were looking for a little help to get through their day.</p>

                    <h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
                    <p>With our research completed, we were able to distil what we learned into a concise problem statement.</p>
                    <h5>Problem Statement</h5>
                    <blockquote>"A person who is feeling down may not want to involve those around them or feels like a burden when asking for help or advice. They have to talk themselves up in order to keep events with friends, and can end up staying home. We hope to offer people a fun way to solve this problem while keeping true to themselves."</blockquote>
